# ðŸŽ¿ Music Data Analysis with PostgreSQL

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This repository contains a collection of SQL queries executed in **pgAdmin** using **PostgreSQL**, focused on analyzing a music streaming database. The queries are divided into two levelsâ€”**Easy** and **Moderate**â€”to practice and strengthen SQL skills with real-world business questions.
